# Dube Mobile Chat Application
The project is a mobile chat application created with Firebase and Expo. Expo and Firebase are set up in the development environment, and then Firebase Authentication is used to provide user authentication and authorization, laying the groundwork for the application. With the use of Firebase's Cloud Firestore, the chat application aims to provide real-time messaging and synchronize messages across multiple devices, resulting in a seamless and connected chat experience. The user interface makes use of Expo's UI elements to produce chat interfaces that are dynamic and easy to use. 

I once built a web app chat application for my family. The reason behind transitioning from a web app chat application to a mobile chat application stemmed from the feedback of users within my family, including my wife, brother, and his wife. While the initial web app, created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node JS, and Express JS, served its purpose, users expressed a desire for a more convenient experience. The advantages they highlighted, such as push notifications for timely alerts, seamless offline access, and a user-friendly interface optimized for mobile devices, were key factors driving the decision to create a dedicated mobile chat application. The shift to mobile aimed to address these preferences, offering a more tailored and responsive communication platform that aligns with the users' expectations and enhances overall convenience.
